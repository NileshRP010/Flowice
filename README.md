# Flowice
Flowice is a decentralized invoice financing platform built on the Finternet using Solana. It enables businesses to tokenize invoices and access global liquidity from investors through a secure, composable, and borderless financial marketplace.

Flowice leverages Solana's speed and composability to build a seamless, interoperable lending ecosystem aligned with the Finternet's vision: connect once, transact globally.

5. **Invoice Paid** → Customer pays to Flowice escrow account
6. **Settlement** → Investor receives principal + returns, minus platform fees
